             Super Metroid is one of the best games for snes.  Super Metroid is the third game of the Metroid series (Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Prime, Metroid Zero Mission, Metroid Prime 2, Metroid Prime Hunters, Metroid Prime 3, Metroid Other M). It appears to be a normal side-scrolling action game, but it tends to give you an RPG feeling.  I decided to make this walkthrough, because there were many points in the game that I got stuck at, and I couldn't find a good walkthough to use.  Many of them were all text, so it was hard to search through, and many I found hard to follow.  Hopefully my guide will be helpful to people, I've tried to make it an efficient route to get 100% of the items.  If there's anything you find I could improve on, feel free to shoot me a message (games2supermetroid at yahoo.com) and I'd be glad to fix it.

             Most of the website was done by me, but here are a few other people that helped to make this page:
             <p>
             My brother for helping me with the walkthrough and for getting me interested in the game.
             <p>
             And, of course, Nintendo for making this great game.
